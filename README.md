# PageRank Demonstration
This repository is a demonstration of the applications of Linear Algebra, namely Eigenvector calculations, to the Pagerank algorithms made famous by Google
## Requirements
This Pagerank demonstration requires Python 3.x and Bash 4.x

`$ python3 --version`

`$ bash --version`

Additionally, this demo employs [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org). Details can be found in `requirements.txt`
## Usage
Simply run the `main.py` file and you'll be given the information on the Pageranks for the given files located in `Pages/`

`$ python3 main.py`

## Sources
I heavily consulted [this paper published by Rose Hulman](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/~bryan/googleFinalVersionFixed.pdf) to learn how exactly PageRank works. You can [download my annotated copy here!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1mmZBsBQ3rnc1dLY3FXOExxcjg)
